## Exercise 1

The responsive page has been created with just plain HTML and CSS using the newly 
available nesting within CSS. A combination of both grid and flex layouts have been 
used to responsively display the page and elements.

The columns change from three to two at an `800px` breakpoint and two to one at a 
`600px` breakpoint with this being inline with the banner image switch too.

This can be found within the `/exercise1` directory.

The provided banner images have just been added to the local repo due to some loading 
issues encountered.

## Exercise 2

The responsive page has been created with Vue.js using just a basic generated app just
using CSS and nesting within CSS. A single component has been created to render both 
an accordion and tabs for mobile devices and desktops respectively.

The tabs on the page will change to an accordion at the `600px` breakpoint with some 
basic animations for expanding each item on the page.

For display purposes, the header/hero banner from *Exercise 1* was added to enhance 
the look and feel of the page.

This can be found within the `/exercise2` directory.

This can be setup by running:

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```

The site can then just be accessed by URL provided within the terminal once started.
